The FTC contended that if the transaction were to proceed Whole Foods Market would have the ability to raise prices and reduce quality and services. Both Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats stated their intention to vigorously oppose the FTC\\'s complaint and a court hearing on the issue was scheduled for July 31 and August 1, 2007.

The tournament is colloquially referred to as \"Worlds\" and the winners of the open competition acknowledged as the \"world champions\". The current world champions, Jason Xiao and Lee Chin Wee, are from the [[University of Oxford]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3853631|title=World Universities Debating Championship dele...|last=News|first=Taiwan|website=Taiwan News|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>. The university with the most world championships is the University of Sydney with 8 victories. The 2020 edition which was the 40th edition was hosted in [[Assumption University (Thailand)|Assumption University]].\\n\\n==History==\\n===Predecessor Tournaments===\\nThe Trans-Atlantic University Speech Association held tournaments in London (1976 and 1978) and at [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]], in 1977. [[University of Chicago|Chicago]] was to hold a tournament in 1979 but this was postponed and then abandoned. A \"World Debating Festival\", sponsored by [[Honeywell]] was held in Sydney in 1978. The TAUSA event attracted mostly [[Northern Hemisphere]] tournaments, the Honeywell was largely [[Southern Hemisphere]].\\n\\n==Format==\\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\\nThe championship is usually held in the days following the 25th of December, since many of the institutions attending from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] where the championship originated take vacations at this time. Although many countries that do not celebrate Christmas have become participants at the competition, the timing has remained the same. In most recent years, the nine preliminary rounds of the tournament have been held over three days from 29–31 December, with the elimination rounds being held on 2 January and the Grand Final on 3 January.\\n\\nIn recent years, the championship has varied from about 150 to 400 teams, depending on the capacity of the host institution. With judges and organisers, this involves 500 to 1,000 participants in all.\\n\\nThe competition involves nine preliminary rounds, which become \"power-paired\" as the tournament progresses, matching the strongest-performing teams against each other. Two teams form the \"government\" (\"proposition\" in the UK and North America) and two the \"opposition\" in each debate room. The process of scoring and pairing these teams is known as \"tabbing\". The scoring of teams is done by judges, most of whom are students or former students from the competing institutions, who return \"ballots\" with their scores to the adjudication team, led by a Chief Adjudicator who is assisted by one or more deputies. The deputies are not members of the host institution.\\n\\nThe nine preliminary rounds are followed by a \"break\" at which the teams proceeding to elimination rounds are announced. This is traditionally done on [[New Year\\'s Eve]], although this is subject to the timing of the tournament. In the current tournament format, the top 16 teams from the preliminary rounds proceed to the octofinal round. The teams ranked 17-48 also break into a partial double octofinal round, and the winning teams from this round join the teams ranked 1-16 in the octo-finals. While preliminary rounds are usually judged by three to five judges, the break rounds are judged by panels of five, semifinal judged by panels of seven and the finals by panels of nine.\\n\\nSeparate breaks are announced for the English-as-a-second language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) team competitions, for the individual [[public speaking]] competition, and the \"World Masters\" tournament which is participated in by judges (most of whom are no longer students) representing the countries where they studied or of which they are citizens. In addition, a comedy competition is also open to all participants in Worlds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about The World Universities Debating Championship 2020|last=|first=|date=2019|website=The 40th World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822052538/http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|archive-date=Aug 22, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\\n\\n==Governance==\\nThe World Universities Debating Council consists of representatives of every country that competes at the World Universities Debating Championship. Each country selects one council delegate (the national debating association president, or selected from the participants at Worlds). The Council is responsible for setting the rules and awarding the right to host the championships.\\n\\nA Worlds Committee is elected to discuss issues during the year as Council only meets at the championships itself.  This Committee consists of a mix of elected officers and regional representatives from [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], Continental [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and the [[British Isles]] (referred to in debating as [[Islands of the North Atlantic]] thought more [[Political Correctness|politically acceptable]] than [[British Isles]]).\\n\\nThe Council formerly operated not unlike the [[United Nations Security Council]], with seven nations holding \"[[charter|charter member]] status\" – the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.  A two-thirds majority of these countries was required for changes to the championship\\'s [[constitution]], irrespective of how the general vote was tallied. However, as the number of non-charter nations attending grew, many fielding far more teams than some of the upper tier, and the championship began being hosted outside the Charter nations, pressure grew for the distinction to be eliminated.\\n\\nThe modern championship grants voting strength of between one and four votes per country, based on numbers of institutions attending recent championships. To allow for fluctuations in participation due to the financial difference in attending championships nearer or further in succeeding years, nations lose or gain their voting strength gradually.\\n\\n== Notable controversies ==\\n\\n=== Thailand WUDC 2020 ===\\nThere was concern over the public debate of Hong Kong in the Open Grand Final motion. This lead to walk-outs during the debate. After the live-stream, all recordings of the debate were deleted and the motion was erased from the tabulation software. Many participants had names removed from the public record retroactively once the competition was over. The organising committee claims this was done to respect participants\\' privacy and denies pressure from any national body or representative.<ref name=\":0\" />\\n\\n=== Cape Town WUDC 2019 ===\\nAccusations of racism were made against members of the organising committee over treatment of participants. On the last day of the competition and just before the Open Grand Final was to begin, an organised protest took place and disrupted the event. Rather than delay the Open Grand Final, speakers and judges were relocated to an undisclosed room and the debate took place in private. This action was the subject of further controversy due to perceived undermining of an anti-racist cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|title=\\'Racism\\' mars world university debate championships at UCT|last=|first=|date=Jan 9, 2019|website=Independent Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605055307/https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|archive-date=Jun 5, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\\n\\n=== [[Chennai Worlds 2014|Chennai WUDC 2014]] ===\\nThis tournament is notable for several controversies.

Historically, the format of WUDC was determined by the host country which allowed for the American Parliamentary Debate format (two teams of two people).<ref>http://www.apdaweb.org/old/guide/rules.html.</ref> Each year, the event is hosted by a university selected by the [[World Universities Debating Council]]. The tournament is colloquially referred to as \"Worlds\" and the winners of the open competition acknowledged as the \"world champions\". The current world champions, Jason Xiao and Lee Chin Wee, are from the [[University of Oxford]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3853631|title=World Universities Debating Championship dele...|last=News|first=Taiwan|website=Taiwan News|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>. The university with the most world championships is the University of Sydney with 8 victories. The 2020 edition which was the 40th edition was hosted in [[Assumption University (Thailand)|Assumption University]].\\n\\n==History==\\n===Predecessor Tournaments===\\nThe Trans-Atlantic University Speech Association held tournaments in London (1976 and 1978) and at [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]], in 1977. [[University of Chicago|Chicago]] was to hold a tournament in 1979 but this was postponed and then abandoned. A \"World Debating Festival\", sponsored by [[Honeywell]] was held in Sydney in 1978. The TAUSA event attracted mostly [[Northern Hemisphere]] tournaments, the Honeywell was largely [[Southern Hemisphere]].\\n\\n==Format==\\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\\nThe championship is usually held in the days following the 25th of December, since many of the institutions attending from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] where the championship originated take vacations at this time. Although many countries that do not celebrate Christmas have become participants at the competition, the timing has remained the same. In most recent years, the nine preliminary rounds of the tournament have been held over three days from 29–31 December, with the elimination rounds being held on 2 January and the Grand Final on 3 January.\\n\\nIn recent years, the championship has varied from about 150 to 400 teams, depending on the capacity of the host institution. With judges and organisers, this involves 500 to 1,000 participants in all.\\n\\nThe competition involves nine preliminary rounds, which become \"power-paired\" as the tournament progresses, matching the strongest-performing teams against each other. Two teams form the \"government\" (\"proposition\" in the UK and North America) and two the \"opposition\" in each debate room. The process of scoring and pairing these teams is known as \"tabbing\". The scoring of teams is done by judges, most of whom are students or former students from the competing institutions, who return \"ballots\" with their scores to the adjudication team, led by a Chief Adjudicator who is assisted by one or more deputies. The deputies are not members of the host institution.\\n\\nThe nine preliminary rounds are followed by a \"break\" at which the teams proceeding to elimination rounds are announced. This is traditionally done on [[New Year\\'s Eve]], although this is subject to the timing of the tournament. In the current tournament format, the top 16 teams from the preliminary rounds proceed to the octofinal round. The teams ranked 17-48 also break into a partial double octofinal round, and the winning teams from this round join the teams ranked 1-16 in the octo-finals. While preliminary rounds are usually judged by three to five judges, the break rounds are judged by panels of five, semifinal judged by panels of seven and the finals by panels of nine.\\n\\nSeparate breaks are announced for the English-as-a-second language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) team competitions, for the individual [[public speaking]] competition, and the \"World Masters\" tournament which is participated in by judges (most of whom are no longer students) representing the countries where they studied or of which they are citizens. In addition, a comedy competition is also open to all participants in Worlds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about The World Universities Debating Championship 2020|last=|first=|date=2019|website=The 40th World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822052538/http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|archive-date=Aug 22, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\\n\\n==Governance==\\nThe World Universities Debating Council consists of representatives of every country that competes at the World Universities Debating Championship. Each country selects one council delegate (the national debating association president, or selected from the participants at Worlds). The Council is responsible for setting the rules and awarding the right to host the championships.\\n\\nA Worlds Committee is elected to discuss issues during the year as Council only meets at the championships itself.  This Committee consists of a mix of elected officers and regional representatives from [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], Continental [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and the [[British Isles]] (referred to in debating as [[Islands of the North Atlantic]] thought more [[Political Correctness|politically acceptable]] than [[British Isles]]).\\n\\nThe Council formerly operated not unlike the [[United Nations Security Council]], with seven nations holding \"[[charter|charter member]] status\" – the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.  A two-thirds majority of these countries was required for changes to the championship\\'s [[constitution]], irrespective of how the general vote was tallied. However, as the number of non-charter nations attending grew, many fielding far more teams than some of the upper tier, and the championship began being hosted outside the Charter nations, pressure grew for the distinction to be eliminated.\\n\\nThe modern championship grants voting strength of between one and four votes per country, based on numbers of institutions attending recent championships. To allow for fluctuations in participation due to the financial difference in attending championships nearer or further in succeeding years, nations lose or gain their voting strength gradually.\\n\\n== Notable controversies ==\\n\\n=== Thailand WUDC 2020 ===\\nThere was concern over the public debate of Hong Kong in the Open Grand Final motion. This lead to walk-outs during the debate. After the live-stream, all recordings of the debate were deleted and the motion was erased from the tabulation software. Many participants had names removed from the public record retroactively once the competition was over. The organising committee claims this was done to respect participants\\' privacy and denies pressure from any national body or representative.<ref name=\":0\" />\\n\\n=== Cape Town WUDC 2019 ===\\nAccusations of racism were made against members of the organising committee over treatment of participants. On the last day of the competition and just before the Open Grand Final was to begin, an organised protest took place and disrupted the event. Rather than delay the Open Grand Final, speakers and judges were relocated to an undisclosed room and the debate took place in private. This action was the subject of further controversy due to perceived undermining of an anti-racist cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|title=\\'Racism\\' mars world university debate championships at UCT|last=|first=|date=Jan 9, 2019|website=Independent Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605055307/https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|archive-date=Jun 5, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\\n\\n=== [[Chennai Worlds 2014|Chennai WUDC 2014]] ===\\nThis tournament is notable for several controversies. This included \"tracking registration payments, to issues with getting participants visas, allocating hotel rooms, picking participants safely up from the airport, toilet paper disappearing, insufficient food provision, and dangerous dirt bike socials\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=How (not) to Run Worlds: Advice from two\\npeople who needed it|url=https://ashtonc.ca/debate/mdr/Monash_Debating_Review-V12.pdf|journal=Monash Debating Review|volume=12|pages=|via=}}</ref> Discontent among judges who had been offered payment in return for participation resulted in strike threats, jeopardizing the 7th round of the tournament.

Tunisia was occupied by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces after [[Operation Torch]] in 1942 and the line was used by the Axis to defend against the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]], which had re-occupied Libya during 1943.\\n\\n==Background==\\n\\n===French strategy===\\nIn 1930s French planning for the defence of the [[French colonial empire]] (French Indochina, Pacific Islands, West Indies, African colonies and Syria–Lebanon) was left to the [[French Foreign Legion]], colonial and \"native\" units, the {{lang|fr|[[Marine nationale]]}} (French Navy) and the {{lang|fr|[[Armée de l\\'Air]]}}. By the late 1930s, the Navy had only one aircraft carrier and the {{lang|fr|Armée de l\\'Air}} could spare only second rate aircraft. [[French Algeria|Algeria]], [[French Protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] and Tunisia provided much of the manpower of the {{lang|fr|[[Troupes coloniales|Armée coloniale]]}} and Tunisia, with the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] to the east, was made an exception to the priority given to the defence of metropolitan France.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=89}}{{sfn|Jackson|2000|pp=332–333}}\\n\\nFrench plans for defence of Tunisia assumed that Italy would launch an overwhelming assault that France could not easily oppose. Italy was expected to launch attacks on [[Egypt]] and Tunisia as soon as war was declared, with the Italian Navy securing supply and blocking any substantial Anglo-French relief. With a force of six divisions, a fortress division and a cavalry division to defend Tunisia, the French army considered the construction of  a \"[[Maginot Line]] in the desert\" ({{lang|fr|ligne Maginot du désert}}).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=92}}\\n\\n===Geography===\\n\\nThe geography of central Tunisia is dominated by the [[Atlas Mountains]], while the northern and southern portions are largely flat. The primary feature in the south is the Matmata Hills, a range running north-south roughly parallel to the Mediterranean coast. West of the hills, the land is the inhospitable [[Jebel Dahar]] then the Dehar region of desert to the west, making the region between the hills and the coast the only easily traversed approach to northern Tunisia.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=46}} A smaller line of hills runs east–west along the northern edge of the Matmata range, further complicating this approach. At the far northern end of the Matmata Hills is the Tebaga Gap.\\n\\n===Plans===\\nIn January 1934 planning began on the new fortifications; Infantry officers selected the sites for strongpoints to dominate the ground in front with overlapping fields of fire. In 1936, the French government provided funds for construction after Italy formed the [[Axis powers|Rome–Berlin Axis]] with Germany, creating a greater threat to French security in North Africa.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}{{efn|The cost of the Mareth line and its forward defences was similar to that of {{lang|fr|ouvrage of St Agnes}} in the Alps.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}}} The casemates designed for the line had much less concrete than comparable examples in France and had no {{lang|fr|[[wkt:fosse|fossé]]}} (gap) rather a stable door, in case the lower part was blocked by débris. In September 1936, during a meeting with General [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|Joseph Georges]], it was agreed that the fortification of the Mareth line, Bizerte, Medenine, Ben Gardane and Foum Tathouine must be completed.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\\n\\nMedenine, Ben Gardane to the west and Foum Tathouine to the east, were south of the proposed line, Foum Tathouine being the place where the routes to Mareth passed through a bottleneck between the Matmata Mountains and the sea. The line was divided into eastern and western sectors with a main line of resistance and a reserve line about about {{cvt|1.5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} back. A {{lang|fr|secteur défensif}} (SD) was to be built on the rocky Dahar Plateau, which later became part of an SD across the Matmata Hills to [[Kebili]] on the edge of the [[Chott el Djerid]]. The chott and and Chott El Fedjaj drained across Tunisia into Wadi Akarit, across Tunisia but Wadi Akarit was only sketchily fortified, the French concentrating on the Mareth line {{cvt|50|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south, to cover Gabes.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\\n\\n==The Mareth Line==\\n\\n[[File:Tunisia Topography.png|thumb|upright=.75|{{center|Topographic map of Tunisia}}]]\\nThe Mareth Line consisted of casemates surrounded by barbed wire and built for for all-round defence in the main and reserve lines, the obstacles being doubled on the fronts and sides. The strongpoints in the main line included flanking machine-gun casemates and anti-tank gun positions; in the reserve line artillery emplacements provided covering fire in the gaps between the strongpoints in the main line. Some of the flanking casemates for machine-guns covering the gaps were connected by galleries; strongpoints on the plain and in hills had anti-tank positions. An anti-tank obstacle of vertical rails was built along the front of the line and the sides of Wadi Zigzaou were steepened. Eight artillery casemates, forty infantry casemates or blockhouses and fifteen command posts were built. The eastern sector had twelve strongpoints in the main line and eleven in the reserve line. The western sector had eleven strongpoints in the main line and seven in the reserve line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\\n\\nIn the Matmata hills, Ksar el Hallouf covered an anti-tank ditch which continued the position beyond the main line which ended on the foothills. An infantry position was dug into the Matmata hills at Ksar-el-Hallouf and in the Dahar beyond, a strongpoint at Bir Soltane had two 75 mm turrets, removed from [[Char 2C]] tanks built in 1918. At Ben Gardane an advanced position was built consisting of a square redoubt inside an anti-tank ditch with casemates on the flanks and concrete infantry shelters. Small triangular strongpoints at the corners were surrounded by anti-tank rail obstacles that continued around the position. After the outbreak of the war a line of {{lang|fr|avant-postes}} advanced positions was built on the high ground of Aram {{cvt|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of the main line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\\n\\n==Second World War==\\n\\nThe [[Second World War]] began in 1939 but the Mareth Line saw no use from 1939–1940, as Italy remained neutral until a few days before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], after which, the line was demilitarised by an Italo-German commission. In November 1942, the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] ([[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]) defeated {{lang|de|[[Panzer Army Africa|Panzerarmee Afrika]]}} at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] landed in French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Axis forces occupied Tunisia in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and from November 1942 to March 1943, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} conducted a fighting retreat through Egypt and Libya, pursued by the Eighth Army. Axis engineers refurbished the Mareth Line for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.  In March 1943, the Eighth Army reached the Libya–Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis forces were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and attempted a spoiling attack, {{lang|de|[[Operation Capri|Unternehmen Capri]]}} (Operation Capri). The attack failed and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line, to await the British attack.{{efn|The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]], [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]], [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]], [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]], [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]], [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light \\'\\'Afrika\\'\\' Division]] and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks. In reserve were the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] with 110 operational tanks. The line from Djebel Tebaga–Djebel Melab was held by the {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}}.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}}} The British survey of the Mareth Line was assisted by General Rime-Bruneau, a former Chief of Staff of the Tunisian garrison and Captain Paul Mezan, the Garrison Engineer of the Mareth Line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\\n\\n===Battle of the Mareth Line===\\n{{Main article|Battle of the Mareth Line}}\\n\\n[[File:Mareth line object.jpg|thumb|{{center|Infantry bunker of the Mareth Line}}]]\\nOn 19 March 1943, the Eighth Army, made a frontal assault in Operation Pugilist. The [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Northumberland Infantry Division]] penetrated the Line near [[Zarat, Tunisia|Zarat]] but was driven back by the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the{{lang|it|Giovani Fascist}} on 22 March.<ref>[https://adviceandresearch.blogspot.com/2019/06/division-giovani-fascisti-in-1943.html Giovani Fascisti division at Mareth]</ref> Earlier reconnaissance by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] had shown that the Line could be outflanked. A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and pass on to the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line, which became known as the \"left hook\". At the same time as Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the gap from 21 to 24 March. Montgomery sent the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] to reinforce the Tebaga attack and put the corps commander, [[Brian Horrocks]], in joint charge. The British attacked again in Operation Supercharge II on 26 March and broke through the gap on 27 March. This success, combined with a fresh frontal assault, made the Mareth line untenable but the Italian 1st Army escaped encirclement when the 1st Armoured Division was held up at El Hamma and the Axis forces retreated to [[Wadi Akarit]], {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip}} to the north.\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{notelist}}\\n\\n==Footnotes==\\n{{reflist|20em}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{refbegin}}\\n* {{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to World War II |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2001 |editor-first=I.

Axis engineers refurbished the Mareth Line for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.  In March 1943, the Eighth Army reached the Libya–Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis forces were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and attempted a spoiling attack, {{lang|de|[[Operation Capri|Unternehmen Capri]]}} (Operation Capri). The attack failed and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line, to await the British attack.{{efn|The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]], [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]], [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]], [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]], [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]], [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light \\'\\'Afrika\\'\\' Division]] and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks. In reserve were the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] with 110 operational tanks. The line from Djebel Tebaga–Djebel Melab was held by the {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}}.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}}} The British survey of the Mareth Line was assisted by General Rime-Bruneau, a former Chief of Staff of the Tunisian garrison and Captain Paul Mezan, the Garrison Engineer of the Mareth Line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\\n\\n===Battle of the Mareth Line===\\n{{Main article|Battle of the Mareth Line}}\\n\\n[[File:Mareth line object.jpg|thumb|{{center|Infantry bunker of the Mareth Line}}]]\\nOn 19 March 1943, the Eighth Army, made a frontal assault in Operation Pugilist.

A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and pass on to the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line, which became known as the \"left hook\". At the same time as Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the gap from 21 to 24 March. Montgomery sent the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] to reinforce the Tebaga attack and put the corps commander, [[Brian Horrocks]], in joint charge. The British attacked again in Operation Supercharge II on 26 March and broke through the gap on 27 March. This success, combined with a fresh frontal assault, made the Mareth line untenable but the Italian 1st Army escaped encirclement when the 1st Armoured Division was held up at El Hamma and the Axis forces retreated to [[Wadi Akarit]], {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip}} to the north.\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{notelist}}\\n\\n==Footnotes==\\n{{reflist|20em}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{refbegin}}\\n* {{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to World War II |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2001 |editor-first=I.
